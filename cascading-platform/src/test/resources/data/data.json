This component will include: civil works for widening and upgrading of approximately 400 km of existing single lane/intermediate lane national highways of Non-National Highway Development Project (NHDP) network in the project states, to two lane standards through item-rate contracts; providing supervision of quality control services, and others including costs towards land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, shifting of utilities. The second component of the project is institutional development component. The project will enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage the non-NHDP network through supporting specific intervention in five areas, viz., process improvements, network monitoring and management, financing, governance and accountability, and training. The third component of the project is road safety component. This component will pursue the objective of improving road safety through: 1) updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; 2) improving road accident data collection and analysis at central and state levels through implementation of the Road Accident Database Management System (RADMS) in project states; 3) strengthening road safety capacity at the central level, and 4)

There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is policy support. This will support developing and implementing Renewable Energy (RE) legislation and policies to achieve cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and smooth grid integration. The second component of the project is grid integration/access and technical design. This component will consist of targeted studies to ensure improved grid integration for large-scale grid-connected RE and grid access for distributed RE; and strategic and optimal deployment of key RE technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The third component of the project is technology improvement. Under this component the technology improvements will include, but not limited to: a) increasing efficiency of existing wind farms; b) improving quality and reliability and reducing costs of off-shore wind turbine technologies; c) increasing efficiency of existing large-scale grid connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) farms; and d) possibly improving Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) domestic manufacturing capacity. The fourth component of the project is pilot demonstration.

The DPL has been prepared jointly with the European Union (EU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), leveraging a further US$ 250 million in support of common key policy actions such as the budget, procurement and open governance reforms. The programmatic approach is warranted by the scope and depth of the government's governance reform program, the implementation of which will require time, assistance, and flexibility. This operation is complemented by the transition fund project supporting the implementation of Morocco's new governance framework. This US$ 4 million grant provides technical assistance for the implementation of structural reforms fostering public engagement; performance based budgeting and fiscal decentralization. The series adopts a holistic and integrated approach to enhance its impact. It is supporting governance reforms across the public sector covering the central government; State owned Enterprises, or SoEs and agencies, local governments as well as inter-governmental relations. The Bank has provided policy advice and technical assistance for the design of most policy measures and laws supported by this DPL, with the support from the MNA multi-donor trust fund. The transition fund governance project will support the implementation of these structural reforms. While building on the long-standing engagement with public administration reform, under the Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL) series, this program supports the concretization of the performance budgeting reform through the adoption and implementation of the new organic budget law and procurement decree.
