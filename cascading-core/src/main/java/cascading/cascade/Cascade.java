/**
 * A Cascade is an assembly of {@link cascading.flow.Flow} instances that share or depend on equivalent {@link Tap} instances and are executed as
 * a single group. The most common case is where one Flow instance depends on a Tap created by a second Flow instance. This
 * dependency chain can continue as practical.
 * <p/>
 * Note Flow instances that have no shared dependencies will be executed in parallel.
 * <p/>
 * Additionally, a Cascade allows for incremental builds of complex data processing processes. If a given source {@link Tap} is newer than
 * a subsequent sink {@link Tap} in the assembly, the connecting {@link cascading.flow.Flow}(s) will be executed
 * when the Cascade executed. If all the targets (sinks) are up to date, the Cascade exits immediately and does nothing.
 * <p/>
 * The concept of 'stale' is pluggable, see the {@link cascading.flow.FlowSkipStrategy} class.
 * <p/>
 * When a Cascade starts up, if first verifies which Flow instances have stale sinks, if the sinks are not stale, the
 * method {@link cascading.flow.BaseFlow#deleteSinksIfNotUpdate()} is called. Before appends/updates were supported (logically)
 * the Cascade deleted all the sinks in a Flow.
 * <p/>
 * The new consequence of this is if the Cascade fails, but does complete a Flow that appended or updated data, re-running
 * the Cascade (and the successful append/update Flow) will re-update data to the source. Some systems may be idempotent and
 * may not have any side-effects. So plan accordingly.
 * <p/>
 * Use the {@link CascadeListener} to receive any events on the life-cycle of the Cascade as it executes. Any
 * {@link Tap} instances owned by managed Flows also implementing CascadeListener will automatically be added to the
 * set of listeners.
