/**
 * An Aggregator takes the set of all values associated with a unique grouping and returns
 * zero or more values. {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.MaxValue}, {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.MinValue},
 * {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.Count}, and {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.Average} are good examples.
 * <p/>
 * Aggregator implementations should be reentrant. There is no guarantee an Aggregator instance will be executed in a
 * unique vm, or by a single thread. The {@link #start(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, AggregatorCall)}
 * method provides a mechanism for maintaining a 'context' object to hold intermediate values.
 * <p/>
 * Note {@link TupleEntry} instances are reused internally so should not be stored. Instead use the TupleEntry or Tuple
 * copy constructors to make safe copies.
 * <p/>
 * Since Aggregators can be chained, and Cascading pipelines all operation results, any Aggregators
 * coming ahead of the current Aggregator must return a value before the {@link #complete(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, AggregatorCall)}
 * method on this Aggregator is called. Subsequently, if any previous Aggregators return more than one Tuple result,
 * this complete() method will be called for each Tuple emitted.
 * <p/>
 * Thus it is a best practice to implement a {@link Buffer} when emitting more than one, or zero Tuple results.

   * the developer to create a new instance, or 'recycle' the given instance. If recycled, it must be re-initialized to

   * <p/>
   * For example, if a Map is used to hold the intermediate data for each subsequent
   * {@link #aggregate(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, AggregatorCall)} call,
   * new HashMap() should be set on the AggregatorCall instance when {@link cascading.operation.AggregatorCall#getContext()} is null.
   * On the next grouping, start() will be called again, but this time with the old Map instance. In this case,
   * map.clear() should be invoked before returning.
