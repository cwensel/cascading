/**
 * A Buffer is similar to an {@link Aggregator} by the fact that it operates on unique groups of values. It differs
 * by the fact that an {@link java.util.Iterator} is provided and it is the responsibility
 * of the {@link #operate(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, BufferCall)} method to iterate overall all the input
 * arguments returned by this Iterator, if any.
 * <p/>
 * For the case where a Buffer follows a CoGroup, the method {@link #operate(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, BufferCall)}
 * will be called for every unique group whether or not there are values available to iterate over. This may be
 * counter-intuitive for the case of an 'inner join' where the left or right stream may have a null grouping key value.
 * Regardless, the current grouping value can be retrieved through {@link BufferCall#getGroup()}.
 * <p/>
 * Buffer is very useful when header or footer values need to be inserted into a grouping, or if values need to be
 * inserted into the middle of the group values. For example, consider a stream of timestamps. A Buffer could
 * be used to add missing entries, or to calculate running or moving averages over a smaller "window" within the grouping.
 * <p/>
 * By default, if a result is emitted from the Buffer before the argumentsIterator is started or after it is
 * completed ({@code argumentsIterator.hasNext() == false}), non-grouping values are forced to null (to allow for header
 * and footer tuple results).
 * <p/>
 * By setting {@link BufferCall#setRetainValues(boolean)} to {@code true} in the
 * {@link Buffer#prepare(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, OperationCall)} method, the last seen Tuple values will not be
 * nulled after completion and will be treated as the current incoming Tuple when merged with the Buffer result Tuple
 * via the Every outgoing selector.
 * <p/>
 * There may be only one Buffer after a {@link cascading.pipe.GroupBy} or {@link cascading.pipe.CoGroup}. And there
 * may not be any additional {@link cascading.pipe.Every} pipes before or after the buffers Every pipe instance. A
 * {@link cascading.flow.planner.PlannerException} will be thrown if these rules are violated.
 * <p/>
 * Buffer implementations should be re-entrant. There is no guarantee a Buffer instance will be executed in a
 * unique vm, or by a single thread. Also, note the Iterator will return the same {@link cascading.tuple.TupleEntry}
 * instance, but with new values in its child {@link cascading.tuple.Tuple}.
 * <p/>
 * As of Cascading 2.5, if the previous CoGroup uses a {@link cascading.pipe.joiner.BufferJoin} as the
 * {@link cascading.pipe.joiner.Joiner}, a Buffer may be used to implement differing Joiner strategies.
 * <p/>
 * Instead of calling {@link cascading.operation.BufferCall#getArgumentsIterator()} (which will return null),
 * {@link cascading.operation.BufferCall#getJoinerClosure()} will return an {@link cascading.pipe.joiner.JoinerClosure}
 * instance with direct access to each CoGrouped Iterator.
