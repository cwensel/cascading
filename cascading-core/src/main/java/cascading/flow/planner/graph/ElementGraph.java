/**
 * Interface ElementGraph holds a directed acyclic graph of {@link FlowElement} instances.
 * <p/>
 * An element graph represents an assembly of {@link Pipe} instances bound to source and sink
 * {@link cascading.tap.Tap} instances.
 * <p/>
 * Typically an element graph is fed to a {@link cascading.flow.planner.FlowPlanner} which in return creates
 * a collection of new element graph instances that represent an executable version of the original graph.
 * <p/>
 * During the planning, multiple intermediate element graphs will be created representing the full graph down to
 * elemental sub-graphs.
 * <p/>
 * There are many concrete implementations of the ElementGraph interface to support this process.
 * <p/>
 * Frequently an element graph will have a single head represented by the singleton {@link Extent#head} and
 * a single tail represented by the singleton {@link Extent#tail}. These are markers to improve the navigability
 * of the element graph. They can be simply masked by wrapping an element graph instance with a
 * {@link ElementMaskSubGraph} class.
 * <p/>
 * An element graph may be annotated if it implements the {@link AnnotatedGraph} interface.
 * <p/>
 * Annotated graphs have FlowElement instances that may have {@link Enum} instances associated with them. A given
 * planner may have rules that apply annotations to various elements that inform a given platform during execuction
 * or downstream rules in the planner {@link cascading.flow.planner.rule.RuleRegistry}.
 * <p/>
 * Any element graph can be written to a DOT file format for visualization via the {@link #writeDOT(String)} method.
