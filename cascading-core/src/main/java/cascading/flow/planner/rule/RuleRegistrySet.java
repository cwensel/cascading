/**
 * Class RuleRegistrySet manages the set of {@link cascading.flow.planner.rule.RuleRegistry} instances that should be
 * applied via the {@link cascading.flow.planner.FlowPlanner} to the given assembly.
 * <p/>
 * The current RuleRegistrySet can be reached via {@link cascading.flow.FlowConnector#getRuleRegistrySet()}, or set with
 * the appropriate {@link cascading.flow.FlowConnector} constructor sub-class.
 * <p/>
 * RuleRegistrySet configuration is mutable to address different situations.
 * <p/>
 * During planner execution, all RuleRegistry instances are applied simultaneously within individual threads.
 * <p/>
 * If the planner duration exceeds {@link #getPlannerTimeoutSec()} (with default
 * {@link cascading.flow.planner.rule.RuleSetExec#DEFAULT_TIMEOUT}) any incomplete planner executions
 * will be cancelled.
 * <p/>
 * If no planner executions complete successfully within the timeout period, an exception will be thrown.
 * <p/>
 * If there are multiple successful completions, the default cost comparator,
 * {@link cascading.flow.planner.rule.RuleSetExec#DEFAULT_PLAN_COMPARATOR}, will be applied to find the lower
 * cost plan. Use {@link #setPlanComparator(java.util.Comparator)} to override.
 * <p/>
 * If all plans have equivalent costs, the plan corresponding to the first most RuleRegistry, as given to the
 * RuleRegistrySet, will be selected.
 * <p/>
 * If {@link #setSelect(cascading.flow.planner.rule.RuleRegistrySet.Select)} is set to
 * {@link cascading.flow.planner.rule.RuleRegistrySet.Select#FIRST}, the first RuleRegistry to complete will be used
 * regardless of cost ordering provided by the plan Comparator. All remaining running planner executions will be
 * cancelled.
 * <p/>
 * If {@link #isIgnoreFailed()} is {@code false}, if any planner execution is times out or fails, an exception will be
 * thrown.
