/**
 * Interface AssemblyPlanner is used to allow for lazy evaluation of a pipe assembly during planning of a {@link Flow}.
 * <p/>
 * This allows for new languages or frameworks that may require additional meta-data from the
 * underlying platform or environment. Specifically field names and type information from incoming source
 * and outgoing sink {@link cascading.tap.Tap}s.
 * <p/>
 * AssemblyPlanner implementations are handed to a {@link cascading.flow.planner.FlowPlanner}
 * instance in the order they should be evaluated.
 * Every instance has the opportunity to replace any prior tails with new branches and paths.
 * <p/>
 * Every instance of AssemblyPlanner evaluated is given the current {@link FlowDef} used on the current
 * {@link FlowConnector}, the current Flow instance (only initialized with source and sink Taps provided by the
 * FlowDef), and the tails provided by the FlowDef or those returned by prior AssemblyPlanner instances.
 * <p/>
 * An AssemblyPlanner cannot change or modify the Flow, or change out any Taps used as sources, sinks, traps, or
 * checkpoints.
 * <p/>
 * This is an experimental API and subject to change without notice.
