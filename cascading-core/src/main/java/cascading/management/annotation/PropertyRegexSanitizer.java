/**
 * PropertyRegexSanitizer is an annotation to be used in conjunction with a Property annotation to sanitize values containing
 * sensitive information with a given regular expression.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if a Property contains an URL, user names, password, API keys etc, one can supply a regular expression
 * (regex) to remove the sensitive parts.
 * <p/>
 * Unlike the {@link cascading.management.annotation.PropertySanitizer} annotation, the regular expression is applied
 * once and the result is stored as the value for the declared {@link cascading.management.annotation.Visibility}
 * for the property. See PropertySanitizer if different values should be returned for each Visibility type.
