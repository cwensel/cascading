 * Sanitizer is an interface to be used in conjunction with {@link PropertySanitizer}.

 * The Sanitizer implementation has the option to provide a different value for each level of
 * {@link cascading.management.annotation.Visibility}.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if the raw value is an URL, the {@code PUBLIC} sanitized value may just include the URL path. The
 * {@code PROTECTED} value may retain the query string, and the {@code PRIVATE} value may retain the scheme and
 * domain name of the server.
 * <p/>
 * If a Sanitizer returns {@code null}, no value will be available for that requested visibility.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of this interface must provide a default no-args Constructor.
