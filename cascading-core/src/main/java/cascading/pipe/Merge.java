/**
 * The Merge Pipe allows for multiple branches, with the same fields to be spliced back into a single stream.
 * <p/>
 * The behavior is similar to the {@link GroupBy} merging features, but Merge does not perform any grouping or
 * sorting on keys. Thus, when using a MapReduce platform, no Reducer is required.
 * <p/>
 * Merge is non-blocking and performs no processing. Any number of branches and merges may be performed in a
 * {@link cascading.flow.Flow} without triggering any additional MapReduce jobs on the Hadoop platform.
 * <p/>
 * Unlike {@link HashJoin}, no preference need be made for left-hand or right-hand sided-ness of streams in relation
 * to their sizes.
