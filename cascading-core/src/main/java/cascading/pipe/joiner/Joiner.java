 * Interface Joiner allows for custom join strategies against a {@link cascading.pipe.CoGroup}.

 * Joins perform based on the equality of the join keys. In the case of null values, Java treats two
 * null values as equivalent. SQL does not treat null values as equal. To produce SQL like results in a given
 * join, a new {@link java.util.Comparator} will need to be used on the joined values to prevent null from
 * equaling null. As a convenience, see the {@link cascading.util.NullNotEquivalentComparator} class.
