/**
 * Class MixedJoin will return an {@link java.util.Iterator} that will iterate over a given
 * {@link Joiner} and return tuples that represent a join as defined by the given boolean array.
 * <p/>
 * So if joining three streams, {@code boolean []{true,false,false}} will result in a 'inner', 'outer', 'outer' join.
 * <p/>
 * Joins perform based on the equality of the join keys. In the case of null values, Java treats two
 * null values as equivalent. SQL does not treat null values as equal. To produce SQL like results in a given
 * join, a new {@link java.util.Comparator} will need to be used on the joined values to prevent null from
 * equaling null. As a convenience, see the {@link cascading.util.NullNotEquivalentComparator} class.
