/**
 * The Comparison interface allows specific underlying type mechanisms to additionally return relevant
 * {@link Comparator} implementations when required internally.
 * <p/>
 * In the case of Hadoop, {@link org.apache.hadoop.io.serializer.Serialization} implementations that present
 * alternative serialization implementations for custom types manged by {@link Tuple}s should also
 * implement the {@link #getComparator(Class)} method.
 * <p/>
 * During runtime Cascading can identify and use the correct Comparator during grouping operations if it was
 * not given explicitly on the {@link Fields#setComparator(Comparable, java.util.Comparator)} family of methods.
 * <p/>
 * See the class {@link cascading.tuple.hadoop.BytesSerialization} for an example.
