/**
 * Interface TupleMapFactory allows developers to plugin alternative implementations of a "tuple map"
 * used to back in memory "join" and "co-group" operations. Typically these implementations are
 * "spillable", in that to prevent using up all memory in the JVM, after some threshold is met or event
 * is triggered, values are persisted to disk.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link Map} classes returned must take a {@link cascading.tuple.Tuple} as a key, and a {@link Collection} of Tuples as
 * a value. Further, {@link Map#get(Object)} must never return {@code null}, but on the first call to get() on the map
 * an empty Collection must be created and stored.
 * <p/>
 * That is, {@link Map#put(Object, Object)} is never called on the map instance internally,
 * only {@code map.get(groupTuple).add(valuesTuple)}.
 * <p/>
 * Using the {@link TupleCollectionFactory} to create the underlying Tuple Collections would allow that aspect
 * to be pluggable as well.
 * <p/>
 * If the Map implementation implements the {@link Spillable} interface, it will receive a {@link Spillable.SpillListener}
 * instance that calls back to the appropriate logging mechanism for the platform. This instance should be passed
 * down to any child Spillable types, namely an implementation of {@link SpillableTupleList}.
 * <p/>
 * The default implementation for the Hadoop platform is the {@link cascading.tuple.hadoop.collect.HadoopTupleMapFactory}
 * which created a {@link cascading.tuple.hadoop.collect.HadoopSpillableTupleMap} instance.
 * <p/>
 * The class {@link SpillableTupleMap} may be used as a base class.
