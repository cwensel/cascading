/**
 * Interface TupleCollectionFactory allows developers to plugin alternative implementations of a "tuple collection"
 * used to back in memory "join" and "co-group" operations. Typically these implementations are
 * "spillable", in that to prevent using up all memory in the JVM, after some threshold is met or event
 * is triggered, values are persisted to disk.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link java.util.Collection} classes returned must take a {@link cascading.tuple.Tuple} as a value.
 * <p/>
 * If the Collection implementation implements the {@link Spillable} interface, it will receive a {@link Spillable.SpillListener}
 * instance that calls back to the appropriate logging mechanism for the platform.
 * <p/>
 * The class {@link SpillableTupleList} may be used as a base class.
